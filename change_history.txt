Trace Tools R8C
 - Internal Improvements

bbfilter 4.0.8
 - New option --auto_print_columns which will show all columns that has data in a log file. The result from this can be  used when creating your own collection or with the --show option.
   See more at https://lmr-bbifilter.rnd.ki.sw.ericsson.se/help?section=example#example2
 - New option --log-filter that filters out a trace or signal among all traces and signals. For instance --log_filter  UpUlMacPeCiUlL1Harqfdbk2DlInd.
 - New option --parameters-summary-filter, which works as --parameters-summary but data is collected from a specific trace  or signal. The result can then be used with the --trace option.
 - Added rule for handling dciBits for TDD for Golden trace.
 - It is now possible to create more than one index in Elasticsearch and it is therefore possible to switch between log  files in Kibana. Read more at https://lmr-bbifilter.rnd.ki.sw.ericsson.se/help?section=getting-started#kibana.
 - It is now possible to also import collections and outputs. Only collections and outputs, that not already exists, are  created. Use --importcollections and --importoutputs for this
 - Pucch/Pusch rules have been updated so that ul.reportType is displayed more frequent in output.
 - ulgrant information was sometimes overwritten by dl information from dci message. The effect of this was that ulgrant  information was sometimes missing in output.
 - Proxy serversettings set in envoirment variables could not be handled by BbFilter.
 - The --show and --show-extra options throw an error if output shortnames were used.
 - Support for importing yaml files with connector functions has been added.
 - Updated Matlab output to support second PUSH allocation.
 - Output was not shown if the output id did not match the input fact id of that output.
 - When a output fact was disconnected from a rule, the fact was deleted. This caused an error in outputs that used this  fact as an input fact.
 - BbFilter is now able to display data from golden uplink signal (UpcDlMacCeFiUlSchedInfoInd). This feature is enabled  with the --golden-ul option.
 - The online gui has been updated to simplify searching for facts.
 - A new option --importrules has been added, which will let you import your own yaml configuration files from BbFilter  version 3 into BbFilter version 4. A forked rule will be created, with your signum as rule name, for each trace/signal  configuration. All necessary facts will also be created. At the moment, only default functions are supported.
 - Added TBS size tables for HOM where ITBS > 26
 - Updated to version R73C of LTNG
 - Users that have been added as collaborators to a forked rule, will now also use that rule prior to the standard rule. 
 - The number of lost traces were increased for traces that was not added in output collection, but exists in log file.
 - The --enable-fact-creation-for did not work as expected.
 - Owner of a resource (rule, collection etc) could not update collaborators they added to that resource,in the online gui.
 - A new tracerule event, RULE(S) NEVER ACTIVATED. This event is created when the rule that is being traced is never  activated. The reason for this is usually that the rule has facts that are activators for the rule, but does not exist in  working memory. These facts should be marked as optional.
 - BbFilter is now compiled for Java 8. If your jre is of an older version, you can use BbFilter 3 instead. (Available at  /proj/lterbsSwdi/bbfilter/3.1.46)
 - It is now possible to specify a certain parameter with the --enable-fact-creation-for option. For instance: --enable-fact -creation-for UpDlMacPeCiDlUeAllocInd.transactionNo
 - The order of output columns, when running bbfilter with --all, was not similar to previous version. This has now been  corrected. 
 - The --trace parameter, from version 3, was not implemented in version 4.
 - Fix for the java.lang.NullPointerException in BBTraceEventProcessor
 - An error, that prevented fact creation for a specific trace, has been fixed.
 - Plots were not created.
 - BbSignalEventProcessor sometimes threw a java.lang.NullPointerException. This has now been corrected.
 - For TDD logs, harq values for secondary cells were not displayed.
 - It is now possible for an output to have both Esper statement and formatter/mapping.
 - Fix for error java.lang.RuntimeException: uncomparable values <<nullnull>>. Occured when a rule were to be executed.
 - Fix for error that made headings occurred on every row when exporting to csv file.
 - An error could sometimes occur when creating collection in the online gui.
 - Param for enable fact creation for a specfic signal/trace name. Usage: --enable-fact-creation-for  UpUlMacPeCiUlL1Measrprt2UlIn
 - Output facts for combined cell configuration
 - BbFilter has been completely rewritten and a rule engine has been implemented with the intention to produce more relevant trace data from log files. An online configuration tool has also been implemented to make it easier to create and update configuration for BbFilter
