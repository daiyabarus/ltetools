          BBFILTER README
===================================

Two versions of bbfilter are included in this package:



Version 2: Script file now renamed "bbfilterOld"
================================================

Version 2 is the old classic verison built in Perl that requires the input log file to be already decoded log.

This version is deprecated and will be removed as soon as we are confident all users have successfully moved over to
bbfilter version 3.



Version 3: Script named "bbfilter"
===========================

Version 3 is completely rewritten in Java for close integration with ltng and for performance. Most legacy functionality
should work.

Important changes:
- The trace file should NOT already be processed with ltng, TET or decode.
- The option --bw is no longer supported. Bandwidth is taken automatically from the traces (see --traces).
- New columns can easily be added via configuration files (no source code change of the bbfilter is needed). More info
  on that in a coming version.

For release-notes run: ./bbfilter --release-notes

Example:
  bbfilter trace.log
  bbfilter trace.log -t http://1.1.1.1
  bbfilter trace.log -t /path/to/translationfile/directory

  
Version 4: Script named "bbfilter"
===========================

In BbFilter version 4, log data is handled by rules and facts in a rule engine and configuration of rules and facts are handled in a online configuration gui.
The goal with this approach is to gather as much data as possible from logs and enable the possibility for users to create their own configurations and share 
these with other users. BbFilter version 4 is runned in the same way as version 3, but some new parameters have been added to facilitate the use of BbFilter.

For more info about how to use the online configuration, see help section in the gui: https://lmr-bbifilter.rnd.ki.sw.ericsson.se/help
